I gained 2 years experience as a Control Engineer at ASM Pacific Technology Hong Kong Ltd. which is a leading semiconductor machine manufacturing organization. The main projects i was involved was feedforward controls for thermal compression bonding heaters, thermal system integration & testing, iterative learning test implementation for turret motors, control architecture development in C++, control UI application development in C++, field tools in Python, and product control support.

I have worked as a Robotics Integration Development Engineer at Shanghai Yikun, which is a small enterprise in Shanghai, China. The core area of work was manipulators integration and testing including ROS software development, field support, and control engineering. 

I recived two Master's by research degrees in the field of Robotics and Control Systems. The former is the M.Phil. in Mechanical Automation Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong and the latter is the MS Control Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. These years I have publised a total of 5 papers in peer reviewed conferences.
